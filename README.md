Some of the codes for this project is costructed based on the code from:
Lagrangian Time Series Models for Ocean Surface Drifter Trajectories
Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics). 65(1), pp. 29-50

by Adam M. Sykulski, Sofia C. Olhede, Jonathan M. Lilly and Eric Danioux (2016)

The folder "Lagrangian_TSM_Drifter" is the python package for optimization and calculating some basic information used for the project.

The folder Map_Visualisation is the code for plotting drifter trajectories in 3D map.

The jupyter notebook "figures.ipynb" is the code for plotting figures in the report.
All data used for visualizing and plot the graph can be found from
